  PM (ivelum)  


  "PM should be a shit umbrella. It means protecting your team members from all the confusing, well-intentioned (but often distracting) requests and nitpicks.  


  Marty Cagan:  

  In the Umbrella model, which is what I believe is absolutely necessary for success, you have a critical role in protecting the product, the team and your customers from these well-intentioned but harmful forces. Now, please don’t misunderstand. Not all requests are harmful. Some will help, and many won’t matter one way or the other. So you’ll need to pick your battles."
